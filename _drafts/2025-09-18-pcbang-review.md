summary: Last month, I visited South Korea with my sister and partner. During the trip, we frequented PC bangs across Seoul. I speak on my general observations of PC bangs and their place in South Korean culture and my personal favorites.

When we first landed in South Korea, we had to take a long train from Incheon Airport to Euljiro and walk across the streets in the rain to our hostel. That night, I experienced my first 24-hour service in South Korea --- a convenience shop, its ready made meals and sweet banana milk (I will speak on them in a different blog post). My first experience led me to take interest in other 24-hour concepts in Korea and the service they provide for residents and tourists alike. As someone who has played League of Legends since I was 9 years old, I was naturally drawn to the concept of PC cafes, their services, and their opportunity to game in the presence of other avid enthusiasts. What I came to learn were the diversity in experience and service I would encounter between different PC bangs, as well as universal amenities I did not expect but greatly appreciated. Most importantly, I realized the appeal of PC bangs, despite their declining need in current society where most people have their own at-home PCs and gaming setups (unfortunately not myself included). 

### Stop 1 - LoL Park PC Bang (**NOT OPEN 24 HOURS**)

I visited my first PC bang at LoL Park while attending a T1 vs. Gen G and DK vs. DN Freecs match.

Though my time here was short (roughly 50 minutes), it was incredibly memorable. My partner and I were assigned seats next to each other, where we eagerly booted up League of Legends together and queued up a swiftplay match. I played Nami support and my partner played Sivir ADC on the North American server (grateful that cross-server compatibility was already set up here!). Despite the ping (~180 ms), we were able to win the match and have a good time playing amongst many other League players and observe their experiences on much more forgiving ping (hello to the Kindred jungle player next to me lol). We cut our game time short because it was primarily a time block to wait for the last DK match to finish and visit DNF during their fan meet and greet (which was really fun!). 

To speak on the logistics and more general notes about our experience, we had to walk to the front counter where the kitchen is to request time because we did not have membership. The folks that we spoke to did not really understand English (a little surprising because it was an LCK venue that many foreigners visit and Reddit said otherwise but at the same time neither extremely shocking or disconcerting), so we translated on our phones our request for game time. We were then asked to give some form of ID (passport/government-issued ID) and then provided a receipt with our seat numbers. The rates are surprisingly comparable to average PC bangs. At the setups, they have all the peripherals you need, including a headset with mic and wireless charging station for your phone. On the launch screens, the emergency exits are displayed as well as the food options available at the PC bang. The kitchen closes by 9 PM while the PC bang itself closed around 10 PM. 

Though I am not entirely sure of the details, there also seemed to be different keyboards and mice you could play with possibly at a different rate, but the set up was comfortable for me in general anyways. The only thing I would say is that it is universally difficult to find monitors that are a good size for playing games like League (smaller monitors). A lot of people around us were playing shooters like Valorant and PUBG as well as MMORPGs which may be better suited for the big screen. 

After our brief experience with the PC bang at LoL Park, my partner and I were motivated to try a PC bang again at least once. The next time we visited was a Nongshim Redforce Arena PC bang in the Sinchon area after we ran our morning errands (PIZZA).
