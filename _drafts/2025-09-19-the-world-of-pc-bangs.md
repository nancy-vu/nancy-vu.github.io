summary: Last month, I visited South Korea with my sister and partner. During the trip, we frequented PC bangs across Seoul. I speak on my general observations of PC bangs, their place in South Korean culture and society, and my personal favorites.

When we first landed in South Korea, we had to take a long train from Incheon Airport to Euljiro and walk across the streets in the rain to our hostel. That night, I experienced my first 24-hour service in South Korea --- a convenience shop, its ready made meals, and sweet banana milk (I will speak on them in a different blog post). My first experience led me to take interest in other 24-hour concepts in Korea and the service they provide for residents and tourists alike. As someone who has played League of Legends since I was 9 years old, I was naturally drawn to the concept of PC cafes, their services, and their opportunity to game in the presence of other avid enthusiasts. What I came to learn were the diversity in experience and service I would encounter between different PC bangs, as well as universal amenities I did not expect but greatly appreciated. Most importantly, I realized the appeal of PC bangs, despite their declining need in current society where most people have their own at-home PCs and gaming setups (unfortunately not myself included). 

### Stop 1 - LoL Park PC Bang (**NOT OPEN 24 HOURS**)

I visited my first PC bang at LoL Park while attending a T1 vs. Gen G and DK vs. DN Freecs match.

Though my time here was short (roughly 50 minutes), it was incredibly memorable. My partner and I were assigned seats next to each other, where we eagerly booted up League of Legends together and queued up a swiftplay match. I played Nami support and my partner played Sivir ADC on the North American server (grateful that cross-server compatibility was already set up here!). Despite the ping (~180 ms), we were able to win the match and have a good time playing amongst many other League players and observe their experiences on much more forgiving ping (hello to the Kindred jungle player next to me lol). We cut our game time short because it was primarily a time block to wait for the last DK match to finish and visit DNF during their fan meet and greet (which was really fun!). 

To speak on the logistics and more general notes about our experience, we had to walk to the front counter where the kitchen is to request time because we did not have membership. The folks that we spoke to did not really understand English (a little surprising because it was an LCK venue that many foreigners visit and Reddit said otherwise but at the same time neither extremely shocking or disconcerting), so we translated on our phones our request for game time. We were then asked to give some form of ID (passport/government-issued ID) and then provided a receipt with our seat numbers. The rates are surprisingly comparable to average PC bangs. At the setups, they have all the peripherals you need, including a headset with mic and wireless charging station for your phone. On the launch screens, the emergency exits are displayed as well as the food options available at the PC bang. The kitchen closes by 9 PM while the PC bang itself closed around 10 PM. 

Though I am not entirely sure of the details, there also seemed to be different keyboards and mice you could play with possibly at a different rate, but the set up was comfortable for me in general anyways. The only thing I would say is that it is universally difficult to find monitors that are a good size for playing games like League (smaller monitors). A lot of people around us were playing shooters like Valorant and PUBG as well as MMORPGs which may be better suited for the big screen. 

After our brief experience with the PC bang at LoL Park, my partner and I were motivated to try a PC bang again at least once. The next time we visited was a Nongshim Redforce Arena PC bang in the Sinchon area after we ran our morning errands (PIZZA!).   

### Stop 2 - Nongshim Redforce Arena 

We visited the Nongshim Redforce PC Cafe in Sinchon, between Sinchon Station and Ehwa Woman's University. Inside, there was a small gift shop on the close left, while the kitchen was on the close right of the entrance. Upon entering, we were taken to the service kiosk to reserve time. Then, unlike the LoLPark PC bang, we chose two empty seats in the cafe and logged on using our unique codes on the ticket. 

The log-in showed us an evacuation map (as usual) and the selection of food and services we had access to. The menu for this PC cafe was cute, featuring emojis in the titles and a large variety of beverages to try. The peripherals featured a gaming headset, keyboard, mouse, and phone charging. 

When we first tried to log onto League of Legends here, we struggled to sign into our NA accounts because the Korean Riot Client has a separate version of Vanguard installed. We ended up asking a worker to help us and she managed to open the general version of Vanguard (found in the menu of games right next to League itself) and prompted us to restart our computers. Then, we were able to access foreign League clients and play a few casual games. The set-up for League was similar to the experience at LoLPark --- the monitors are a bit large for League, but probably fitting for FPS games and other genres --- except the mouse and keyboard were a little less comfortable/inconsistent for me personally (hygienic reasons?).

Ultimately, though this PC cafe was not extraordinary in any particular way, it was comfortable and we were able to relatively easily access foreign servers. This was not the reality for us at our next stop. 

### Stop 3 - Optimum Zone PC Cafe

We visited this PC cafe after attending another LCK match and leaving with little to do at half past 10 in the night. We ended up navigating on Naver Map to the Jonggak Street of Youth and ran into the flashy yellow exterior of the PC bang. Upon entry, the PC bang looked very well kept and inviting. After my experience at Nongshim Redforce, I naturally went through with purchasing tickets for my group of 3. Then, we chose three seats by each other (one of them still had someone else's finished food there, but we moved it to a cart nearby). Here, the peripherals were the same as the other PC cafes we had gone to. However, the food and services were a bit more expensive (we found out why later --- this PC Cafe has some extra amenities such as the couples area and bigger menu of food). 

My partner and I sat down to play League together while my sister did her dailies on Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail. Here, we ran into the issue where there were no capabilities to play on foreign servers. I neglected to ask the worker beforehand because I presumed that there would be methods just like at Nongshim Redforce. Ultimately, my partner ended up playing Fortnite, which was still enjoyable. 

The PCs ran the game very well and I didn't really feel any latency while playing on foreign servers. The setups were also relatively well-kept, though the monitors were still a little too big for League. 

### Stop 4 - KT Rolster/nu Cafe



### Stop 5 - Gallery PC Cafe

This is probably my contender for top 2 better budget PC cafes available right off of Sinchon station (next to the KT Rolster/nu PC bang). The price is comparable to all the other PC cafes while offering a variety of setups depending on your preference (240Hz monitors, the couples area, curved montiors, etc). Furthermore, the service here was nice; the worker was very patient with us when we ordered food and had some dietary restrictions. Though they were not initially sure if we could play League on foreign servers, it was automatically accessible to us without having to make any extra adjustments. 

I also appreciated this set-up because the monitor sizes were more accessible to me. In general, the diversity of options makes it quite easy to pick and choose according to your gaming preferences. All the peripherals were well managed and the vibes were just nice here. We ended up visiting this PC bang a few times and enjoyed the environment of other League and Valorant players. During our session here, my sister even joined us for some Doom Bots matches when she hasn't played League in years. I really recommend this PC cafe as an accessible option for comfortable gaming (as well as other activities such as streaming movies and such --- most PC bangs have streaming services available). I also did order some food here and it was yummy (though I never frequented PC bangs at a regular time to eat so I was often eating appetizers and snacks with a sweet beverage). The tea here was refreshing and nice to have while playing. 

### Stop 6 - Nongshim Redforce Arena (a different one!)

### Stop 7 - Cozy PC Cafe

### Stop 8 - Optimum Zone PC Cafe (a different one!)

### Stop 9 - T1 Base Camp

This was the most expensive option of all the PC cafes we frequented, but understandably so. The setups are completely decked out ---  the couples seating itself features one singular, gigantic montior where each person uses a side of the monitor. Furthermore, the peripherals included a [brand] mouse and [brand] keyboard. The menu has featured recommended items based on the T1 members (marketing tactics :p) and a large variety of food options. 

Ultimately, while it was really cool to play in a place like T1 Base Camp, it is definitely not economical and does not offer any big enough amenities or experiences to frequent more than a few times. Perhaps it is worth it with Korean residence, as this allows you to purchase hours with a membership which reduces the cost significantly. Moreover, the area may be fun to frequent since Base Camp is in Hongdae, where there are many other places to visit (e.g. Hongdae Street, AK Plaza, etc).

###  Conclusions

I think PC cafes have a special place in my heart and in my memories of Korea, though it may be a personal bias being someone who enjoys gaming. I think it is an affordable activity that anyone can partake in in the night time when you're tired of being a regular tourist, walking in capitalist wonderland. Korea has a lot to experience in the day time, but I feel that PC cafes are a nice option for people who want to enjoy the night time without going clubbing and/or getting intoxicated. I also think it creates a very inclusive space for people to enjoy their hobbies outside of working and grinding it out and possibly meet others indulging in the same interests. 

Though I am unsure how the culture is exactly developing in Korea, I hope that PC bangs continue to have a place in Korean society, where Koreans and visitors alike can enjoy time resting from their long days. I understand that it is losing its practical value given that most people have some form of a PC setup to do daily work and relax at home. Despite this, I think it also an accessible option for people who cannot afford good PCs and internet otherwise. Personally, I wish there were more affordable options near me in the United States (I play games on a 5 year old laptop with internet that regularly disconnects). In the US, I think it may particularly thrive as a communal and social space, given that Americans are more willing to make conversation with strangers than Koreans may be (preference for personal space, less of a service culture).
