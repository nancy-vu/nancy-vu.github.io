title: Thoughts on Justice Next Cohort: Weekend 1 (09/20/2025-09/21/2025)
date: 2025-09-23
summary: The first weekend of the Justice Next Cohort was this last Saturday and Sunday. It is my first organized program working with other young adults in Arizona after studying out-of-state in Philadelphia. I reflect on my time and experience with learning along with my peers and building new connections, filled with both hope and some initial concerns.

### General Overview of the Program

The Justice Next Cohort is a 

This is the second time that the Justice Next Cohort is being hosted in Phoenix, Arizona. Last spring, it was hosted in Sacramento, California. 


### Day 1: Getting to Know Each Other & Training/Talks on Organizing 

The day started off with 

Our main talk/lecture/training of the day was led by Sean Wilson, the [insert role] at Dream.Org. He spoke to us about his personal and professional life leading up to the present-day and what has guided his work. 

As part of this training, we mind mapped ways we would organize to protest ICE raids in Arizona using our own network and the pre-existing resources within our community to organize a base of supporters for our cause. This exercise pushed us to examine the key roles in organizing, including the storyteller/presenter, the transportation manager, the food and catering manager, the music and entertainment manager, and outreach manager.

At the end of the day, we discussed pluses and deltas (aka positives & places for improvement) for the program and how each session can be improved upon for all participants. 

### Day 2: Connecting & Training/Talks on Mentorship & Campaigns

Day two started off similarly, with the participants having breakfast together and socializing. By this point, many groups have already formed while others make the effort to mingle with new folks. 

The first talk was led by Yuri, [insert role], on mentoring and essential mentoring skills and philosophies. Similarly to Sean, she started off her talk by sharing her background and what brought her to this space. She described the long activist history in her family line and how it has guided her in her current work --- many of her ancestors were part of the Black Panther Party as well as the [other party...]. She mentioned that her name, Yuri, comes from her godmother Yuri Kochiyama (icon!!!), whose legacy continues to guide her work today. 

The second talk/training was led by Jessica Johnson, [insert role], on campaigns and effective campaign strategy. 


### My Overall Thoughts and Feelings

I am excited for the opportunity to connect with more people in Arizona and learn about how I can engage with justice work close to me (e.g. the intersections of climate, migration, and environmentalism). I believe that this program will introduce me to many new people in my community and perspectives that can broaden my understanding and connection with not only the political landscape of Arizona, but those working on the frontlines to make it a place for all people to thrive (while it currently is a place of systemic violence for many minority groups). 

So far, we've already engaged in many icebreaker activities and discussion sessions that allowed us to share some of our vulnerable moments and perspectives underpinning our shared commitment to justice work. On some levels, I am aligned with my peers and in other aspects I see room to grow for the both of us. I am eager to continue having conversations with the youth in my community so that we can mutually grow into increasingly empathetic, compassionate, and learned activists, especially for the politically disenfranchised in our communities whose voices are often left unheard in public political discourse. 

I also hope that I can bring my personal identities and experiences forward to enrich the learning and engagement of my peers. There are already some moments where we have clashed or struggled to see eye to eye, but I am hopeful that we can engage with empathy and openness to continuous improvement, rather than distaste/contempt/ostracization. I have been pushed to evaluate my work more deeply and develop a stronger conviction/understanding of why it is that I engage and how I should moving forward in an intentional and responsive way to the contexts from which people come, rather than through an idea of what I think needs to be done without the deep understanding/local knowledge of issues that concern multiply marginalized communities in the Phoenix area.

- hope in meeting new folks, learning about opportunities to tap in, connect, engage, and do important work
- new insights into how work is actually done and done effectively and with compassion, integrity, commitment to the politically disenfranchised
- discussions and hands-on work to get thoughts flowing, room for growth 
- ice breaker activities --- a mix of fun and tension (vulnerability) 
- empathy and responsibility to shared goals, commitment, maintaining respect and trust for each other through difficulty, tension, differences in worldviews
