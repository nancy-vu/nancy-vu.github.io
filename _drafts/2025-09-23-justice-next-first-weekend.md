title: Thoughts on Justice Next Cohort: Weekend 1 (09/20/2025-09/21/2025)
date: 2025-09-23
summary: The first weekend of the Justice Next Cohort was this last Saturday and Sunday. It is my first organized program working with other young adults in Arizona after studying out-of-state in Philadelphia. I reflect on my time and experience with learning along with my peers and building new connections, filled with both hope and some initial concerns.

### General Overview of the Program

The Justice Next Cohort is a 

This is the second time that the Justice Next Cohort is being hosted in Phoenix, Arizona. Last spring, it was hosted in Sacramento, California. 


### Day 1: Getting to Know Each Other & Training/Talks on Organizing 

The day started off with 

Our main talk/lecture/training of the day was led by Sean Wilson, the [insert role] at Dream.Org. He spoke to us about his personal and professional life leading up to the present-day and what has guided his work. 

At the end of the day, we discussed pluses and deltas (aka positives & places for improvement) for the program and how each session can be improved upon for all participants. 

### Day 2: Connecting & Training/Talks on Mentorship & Campaigns

Day two started off similarly, with the participants having breakfast together and socializing. By this point, many groups have already formed while others make the effort to mingle with new folks. 

The first talk was led by Yuri , [insert role], on mentoring and essential mentoring skills and philosophies. Similarly to Sean, she started off her talk by sharing her background and what brought her to this space. She described the long activist history in her family line and how it has guided her in her current work --- many of her ancestors were part of the Black Panther Party as well as the [other party...]. She mentioned that her name, Yuri, comes from her godmother Yuri Kochiyama (icon!!!), whose legacy continues to guide her work today. 


The second talk/training was led by Jessica Johnson, [insert role], on campaigns and effective campaign strategy. 


### My Overall Thoughts and Feelings
- hope in meeting new folks, learning about opportunities to tap in, connect, engage, and do important work
- new insights into how work is actually done and done effectively and with compassion, integrity, commitment to the politically disenfranchised
- discussions and hands-on work to get thoughts flowing, room for growth 
- ice breaker activities --- a mix of fun and tension (vulnerability) 
- empathy and responsibility to shared goals, commitment, maintaining respect and trust for each other through difficulty, tension, differences in worldviews
- money, resumes, the performance to survive an unnatural, capitalistic society and reckoning with it as a neurodivergent individual.
