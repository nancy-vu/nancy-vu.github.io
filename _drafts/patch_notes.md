Here, I will document the changes I am making to the site separate from my blog posts so that edit logs are not overcrowding the blog and my blog content. I will provide more in-depth thoughts on specific features of interest in case it would help anyone trying to create a blog on their own instead of spending money on some website/blog builders like WordPress and SquareSpace (may or may not be helpful considering I am a complete newbie lol).

### September 18th, 2025
- Creating plans to merge default and main layouts once the website becomes whole (not having separate headers for blog page versus main page... having a better dropdown color scheme)
- Created a projects page (no content yet)
- Added footer to blog page
- Created back and next buttons
- Created template for recipe pages when I make a collection of my go-to recipes as a young unemployed person

### September 16th, 2025
- Added tags
- Edited main blog page to include tags next to date
- Changed side bar on posts from "Suggested Posts" to "Other Posts" in lieu of adding suggested posts based on related tags 
- Created drafts folder for unpublished content/WIPs
