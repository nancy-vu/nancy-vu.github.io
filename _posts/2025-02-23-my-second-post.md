title: "Day 2: Massive Cleanup on Aisle 5!"
date: 2025-02-19
summary: "On the second day of blog creation, I cleaned up the layout of my site and the organization of my files so it is much much more intuitive in my repository now. I feel like I have the foundation of my blog fully set up and also fixed the HTML and Markdown integration for other pages of my site besides the blog. I have fixed all my permalinks and created a new folder to host any of my repeated code (e.g. footers and headers across all pages) so I am not writing the same block in every layout or page."

**Some steps I took today (will revisit to flesh out more!):**
- Created an "_includes" folder for my universal HTML blocks (e.g. header.html, footer.html, sidebar.html). 
- Created a "pages" folder for all the individual pages of my site, including the homepage, the portfolio page, and the blog homepage. 
- Created additional layout HTML files and simplified my existing ones so they are more universal. 
- Created additional CSS styling pages for the unique pages and elements (footer, blog vs posts). 
- Added a footer with social media icons and links.
- Converted all old HTML files for my pages to Markdown files that have cleaner code. 

**Some notes on HTML & CSS formatting that I learned in the process!**

#### To-Do List

- [ ] Create tags for my posts so that my suggested posts includes only posts related to the topic. Maybe list all the tags under the title of my blog posts (on the main page and the block page!) **(medium priority)**
- [ ] Create a comment box at the bottom of posts. Use a similar format for my contact box! (test drive a few times on an alt email!) **(medium priority)**
    - ask for alias/anonymous name
    - [for contact box] ask for email/phone number
    - comment
    - post button
- [ ] Add a "last edited" part near the publication date? Learn how to make that automated based on commit logs or something? **(high priority!)**
- [ ] Create a share button. **(low priority)**
- [ ] Finish all my details on the how-tos that I completed for the first two parts of my blog creation process. Want to make this blog also a resource for others who view it! **(high priority!)**
- [ ] Create pop-ups by writing JS script files! **(low priority -- for this step in my journey at least!)**
