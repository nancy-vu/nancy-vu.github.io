        <h2>Welcome to my Blog!</h2>
        <p>In this blog, I will try to document my progress learning how to create a functional site. Then, I will branch off to making it more aesthetically pleasing (and interesting) with more interactivity if possible. Feel free to tag along this adventure with me!</p>
        <p>In general, I hope to use this blog as a way to learn how to code better and connect with anyone who wants to learn about me in a more intimate manner. As part of this project, I may ramble about my other interests, including film and media, embroidery and painting, and global political issues that I am reading about. Looking forward to exploring this project more! :)</p>

                        <p><small>I reflect on my goals and place as a human in this world and how I have contended with various pressures to become something recognizable to others but not my own self. I talk about my desire to do data science but from my math roots and passion for social change rather than forcing myself to learn skills just for an income and career stability. I talk about my value as a person and not something replicable by artificial intelligence.</small></p>

                        <p><small>On the second day of blog creation, I cleaned up the layout of my site and the organization of my files so it is much much more intuitive in my repository now. I feel like I have the foundation of my blog fully set up and also fixed the HTML and Markdown integration for other pages of my site besides the blog. I have fixed all my permalinks and created a new folder to host any of my repeated code (e.g. footers and headers across all pages) so I am not writing the same block in every layout or page.</small></p>

                        <p><small>For my first day of creating this blog, I set up Jekyll on my computer in order to create a list of recent posts. Then, I plan on writing Markdown and HTML files in order to stylize the individual blog posts and my blog page overall. In the process, I need to do file clean up between my existing repository and the new organization to work with Jekyll.</small></p>
