                <p>Today, I spent most of my day setting up Jekyll on my Mac and familiarizing myself with its uses and setup since I have not manually created a blog and its individual blog posts before. Usually, I have used SquareSpace to post any online materials. I am excited to learn to do these things from scratch, and I am especially excited to write in Markdown files more. In my opinion, I find Markdown files more intuitive and nice to write for blogging. This might just be my bias because my first programming language was R (not sure I did too much programming back then though.. mostly packages other people have already designed since I mostly used it to do statistical tests and generate sample experiments). I am still figuring out how I will incorporate a mix of HTML/Markdown, but I think I will figure that out but figuring out what each is better used for on my site. For now, I am thinking of converting most of my connections between blog main page to blog posts as Markdown files. Perhaps I will write the layout templates in HTML (and then convert them to Markdown files once I get all the stylizations right?). If I create large stylizations in HTML, I may create a few style sheets and leave them in my layouts folder. After creating my templates, I also need to clean up my file organization because I initially created this site to create a personal portfolio and add other widgets I might want to access and show as part of my “portfolio” (more hands-on materials and references of my work… part of this is creating a more active GitHub profile and showcasing my other interests outside of research and academics). I only recently merged my GitHub page with Jekyll and this has automatically re-sorted some of my files in a somewhat confusing/redundant way. I hope the clean up won’t cause any issues, but I’ll be sure to keep back ups just in case!</p>

<p>I will likely revisit my initial blog posts to clean up the way my paragraphs are spaced and such. A general refernece I am referring to for GitHub is the following <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax">link</a>.</p>

<h3 id="jekyll-set-up-process-for-me-at-least">Jekyll Set-up Process (for me at least…)</h3>

<p>When I was setting up my Jekyll, I installed Homebrew through my terminal using the line: /bin/bash -c “$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)”.</p>

<p>Using Homebrew, I installed Ruby (brew install ruby). Though Ruby is usually already installed on Mac, it was an older version so I wanted to update it. Then, I set the new Ruby on my path so that it is clear which version I wanted to work on.</p>

<p>… more details tbd</p>

<h3 id="to-do-list">To-Do List</h3>

<p>[ ] Write first two blog posts (or templates) and see how they appear on the main site. <strong>(High Priority!!)</strong>
[ ] Create two layout files. One for the main homepage and one for the blog posts. (Unless I should be stylizing the homepage in some other way.. will continue thinking!) <strong>(High Priority!!)</strong>
[ ] Clean up my files and remove duplicates.  <strong>(Medium Priority)</strong>
[ ] Review typesetting / LaTex integration rules. <strong>(Medium-Low Priority)</strong> 
[ ] Clean up my code so it is more readable.. add comments and remove inefficient lines.  <strong>(Last task – “low” priority)</strong></p>
